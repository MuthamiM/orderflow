# Orderflow 001 Hackathon - Q&A

**Q: What is the Orderflow 001 hackathon?**
A: It is a 48-hour build sprint focused exclusively on on-chain trading systems and prediction market automation. It is not a pitch or UI contest; the goal is to build a real, functioning system.

**Q: What are the key dates?**
A: 
- **Applications Close:** March 15, 2026
- **Accepted Teams Announced:** March 18, 2026
- **48-Hour Build Window:** March 22–24, 2026 

**Q: Who can participate and how large can teams be?**
A: Anyone 13+ from eligible countries, especially crypto-native developers, quant engineers, and automation-focused traders with prior development experience. You can work solo or in a team of up to 4 members.

**Q: Where is the communication centralized?**
A: All announcements, schedule updates, team finding, and technical questions will be handled in the official Discord: https://discord.gg/sBpdNqVywZ

**Q: What exactly needs to be built?**
A: A working system with measurable output related to on-chain trading or prediction markets. Examples include:
- Polymarket trading bots
- Live execution engines reacting to odds
- Probability decay models
- Risk-adjusted portfolio allocators
- Backtesting frameworks
- Real-time market signal pipelines

*(Note: If using AI, it must provide real functionality, not just UI enhancements.)*

**Q: What are the project tracks?**
A: 
1. **Quantitative Trading:** (e.g., market-making bots, arbitrage engines)
2. **On-Chain Intelligence:** (e.g., wallet tracking, MEV detection, behavioral analytics)
3. **Automation & Infrastructure:** (e.g., risk engines, backtesting frameworks)
4. **AI-Augmented Systems:** (e.g., event modeling, sentiment pipelines)

**Q: What are the submission requirements?**
A: Submissions must go through Devpost before the deadline and include:
1. A public GitHub repository.
2. A 2–3 minute demo video.
3. A clear explanation of the strategy logic, architecture, data sources, performance metrics, and measurable output (backtest, simulation, or live data).
*Submissions without a working implementation will not be ranked.*

**Q: How will the projects be judged?**
A: The Orderflow Review Panel will judge based on:
- **Technical Depth:** Architecture, engineering quality, data integration.
- **Strategy Logic:** Clarity of edge hypothesis, probabilistic reasoning, risk management.
- **Measurable Output:** Backtest integrity, metric clarity, reproducibility.
- **Implementation Quality:** Code structure, documentation, clarity.

**Q: What is the prize pool?**
A: A total of $500 in cash prizes:
- **1st Place (Performance Leader):** $250
- **2nd Place (Technical Excellence):** $150
- **3rd Place (Strategy Distinction):** $100
